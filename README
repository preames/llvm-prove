'llvm-prove.py test.ll'

A simple helper script to use LLVM's optimizer as a prover.  LLVM makes
a very bad general prover, but can often be moderately effective on 
proof examples extracted from programs.  The language of the proof to
attempt is a single LLVM IR function returning i1 (boolean) which is the
condition attempting to be proven.
